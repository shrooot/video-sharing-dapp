# video-sharing-dapp
A YouTube like video sharing application which is decentralized.

It uses the ethereum smart contract functionality.

Make sure you have the following pre-requisites:

1. MetaMask Chrome Extension and a MetaMask account. If not visit https://metamask.io/

2. Ganache for making a local etherium development environment. https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache

3. Truffle for compilation, running scripts, testing, etc.  https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/overview

To run the program first clone the repository 

 `git clone https://github.com/yashraj-02-techie/video-sharing-dapp.git`
 
Then install the packages using npm

`npm install`

Connect your local etherium environment to MetaMask wallet

Find customRPC option under networks and then add the URL from the Ganache GUI. Add Chain ID as 1337

Once you are connected you can then run the command

`npm run start`

This would load the front-end written in react
